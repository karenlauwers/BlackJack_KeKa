BlackJack is a card game played against a dealer (=the computer). 
You try to get a value of cards that's 21 or as close to 21 as possible.
You're busted when the value of your cards is more than 21.
The value of the cards are as follows: 
- J, Q, K are worth 10
- A is worth 1 if the sum of the cards played is greater than 10
- A is 11 if the sum is 10 or lower than 10.
- other cards have their own value 
In this game, you play 5 rounds. 
NAME: start by entering your name with a maximum of 20 characters.
BET: choose a bet between 1 and 999€. 
    - You will play 5 rounds with your bet. 
    - So your total bet will be 5x your bet. 
Game: 
- DEAL CARDS: start the game or a next round by clicking 'Deal cards'
- You and the dealer receive 2 cards. 
- You can see both your cards, you can only see the first card of the dealer. 
- If your first 2 cards give 21 (A + 10, J, Q or K), you have blackjack.
    - If the dealer also has a blackjack, it's a tie. 
    - If the dealer has no blackjack, you win the blackjack.
- HIT: if the value of the first 2 cards is not 21, you can ask for one more card by clicking 'Hit'
    - If the sum of the cards is still too low for you, you can ask for one more card. 
    - You cannot ask for one more card. You can have a maximum of 4 cards in your hand. 
    - If the sum of the cards is more than 21, you're busted. You lose. 
- STAND: if you want to stay with the cards you have, after the deal or after one hit, you click 'Stand'
- DEALER'S ACTION: after you have asked for 2x hit or 1x stand, the dealer will make his action:
    - The hidden dealer's card is shown. 
    - If the dealer's value is lower than 17, the dealer will pick one or two more cards. 
    - The dealer can have a maximus of 4 cards. 
- RESULT: 
    - If your value is greater than 21, you are busted. You always lose. If the dealer's busted as well, you are in disadvantage. 
    - If your value is equal to the dealer's value, it's a tie.
    - If your value is closer to 21 than the dealer's value, you win. 
    - If your value is further from 21 than the dealer's value, you lose. 
    - 21 is only a blackjack if you make 21 with the first deal of cards. 
        - 21 after hitting for more cards, is considered as other results. 
- SCORE: 
    - Blackjack = you win 1.5x your bet, so: 10€ bet, you get 25€ = 10€+(10€*1.5)
    - Win = you win 1x your bet, so: 10€ bet, you get 20€ = 10€+(10€*1) 
    - Tie = you win nothing, you lose nothing, so: 10€ bet, you get 10€
    - Lose = you lose your bet, so: 10€ bet, you get 0€
